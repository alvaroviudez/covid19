*Analysis of the official metric of COVID-19 evolution in Spain*

In order to follow the success or failure of the different measures to prevent as many deaths as possible, we need reliable metrics showing the evolution of the pandemic, such as number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, <ins>the Spanish government stopped following up the total number of COVID-19 cases since March 28, 2022; and restricted the follow up to people with ages 60 or above</ins>. This fact surprised me and I wondered if maybe that metric is more or less representative of the total pandemic evolution in Spain. The final goal of the present project is to answer that question.
